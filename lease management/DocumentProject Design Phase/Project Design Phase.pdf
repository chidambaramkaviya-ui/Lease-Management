### **1️⃣ Purpose of the Design Phase**

The **Design Phase** transforms the ideas and requirements identified in the Ideation Phase into a **structured technical plan**.
It defines **how** the system will look, function, and interact — serving as a **blueprint** for developers to build the system.

---

### **2️⃣ Design Objectives**

* Convert user requirements into a logical and physical system design
* Define the system’s architecture, data flow, and database structure
* Create user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) layouts
* Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability in the design

### **3️⃣ System Architecture**

**Architecture Type:** *Three-Tier Architecture*

| Layer                  | Description                             | Example                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Presentation Layer** | Handles user interface and interactions | Salesforce Lightning pages / Web UI                      |
| **Application Layer**  | Contains business logic and workflows   | Apex classes, triggers, and validation rules             |
| **Database Layer**     | Stores and manages lease-related data   | Salesforce objects like Property, Tenant, Lease, Payment |

This separation ensures **modularity**, **security**, and **easy maintenance**.

### **4️⃣ Data Flow Diagram (DFD – Level 0 & 1)**

#### **DFD – Level 0**

Represents the overall system interaction.

**Entities:**

* Tenant
* Property Owner
* System Database

**Process:**

* Tenants send lease data → System stores lease → Owner reviews & manages

#### **DFD – Level 1**

Shows internal system flow:

1. User inputs lease details
2. System validates and stores them in the database
3. Notifications triggered for payment and renewal
4. Reports generated and displayed on dashboard

### **5️⃣ Entity–Relationship (ER) Diagram**

**Entities and Attributes:**

| Entity          | Attributes                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tenant**      | Tenant_ID, Name, Email, Phone, Address                              |
| **Property**    | Property_ID, Name, Location, Type                                   |
| **Lease**       | Lease_ID, Start_Date, End_Date, Rent_Amount, Property_ID, Tenant_ID |
| **Payment**     | Payment_ID, Lease_ID, Amount, Date, Status                          |
| **Maintenance** | Maintenance_ID, Lease_ID, Description, Status                       |

**Relationships:**

* One **Tenant** can have multiple **Leases**
* One **Property** can have multiple **Leases**
* Each **Lease** can have multiple **Payments**
* Each **Lease** can have multiple **Maintenance Requests**

---

### **6️⃣ User Interface (UI) Design**

**Modules and Layout:**

* **Dashboard:** Summary of leases, payments, and maintenance requests
* **Lease Management Page:** Create, edit, and view lease details
* **Tenant Module:** Manage tenant profiles
* **Property Module:** Manage property details
* **Payment Module:** Record and track rent payments
* **Reports Page:** Generate lease and payment reports

UI designed to be **clean, simple, and responsive** for both admin and tenants.

---

### **7️⃣ Security Design**

* User authentication and role-based access control
* Data encryption for sensitive details (e.g., lease documents)
* Validation rules to prevent invalid data entries
* Secure APIs for integration

---

### **8️⃣ Design Tools Used**

* **Salesforce Object Manager** – for entity design
* **Lucidchart / Draw.io** – for DFD and ER diagrams
* **Figma / Salesforce Lightning App Builder** – for UI mockups

---

### **9️⃣ Expected Output**

A fully defined **technical design document** ready for development that ensures:

* Smooth workflow automation
* Secure data management
* Easy-to-use interface for tenants and landlor
